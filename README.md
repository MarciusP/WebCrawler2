# WebCrawler2
I was trying to use selenium library to navigate through the given SAS page, but the page asked to complete a captcha. However, as Robertas suggested,
I made a program to read html of the SAS flights web page from a file to scrap the information about the flights. To navigate around html file I
was using Jsoup library.
